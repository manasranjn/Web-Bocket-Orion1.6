Q. What is Multi-page-application ?
- It is an application where it will be having multiple pages, or multiple HTML files.
- If we try to navigate from one page to another page everytime it is going to refresh or each time DOM structure will be created.
- So this makes applications slower.
- We can create multi-page-application using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Q. What is Single-page Application ?
- It is an application where it will be having single page, or single HTML file.
- If we try to navigate from one page to another page it will not gonna refresh, because we will be staying in a the same HTML file, but we are moving from one component to another component.
- So this makes applications faster.
- To create a Single-page application(SPA) we need some advance concept like angula, jQuery or React.JS etc.. .

# ReactJS
- It is a JavaScript library (collection of pre-defined codes).
- It is used to build user interfaces.

## Features of ReactJS
1. Single-Page-Application (SPA)
- e.g :- Whatsapp, facebook, Gmail, etc ..

2. Virtual DOM
3. Component based Architecture(CBA):- React follows CBA, because we can reuse the components, better code maintainability.
- Web pages will be divided into small parts and that small parts are called components.
- Components can be reused in different web pages.

## Folder Structure of ReactJS
    After successfully installation of react.js, we will be getting some default folders and files.

1. node_modules :
- It is a folder where all the pre-defined codes and dependencies of react.js will be present.
- We don't need to change anything in this folder.

2. public :
- This folder conatins the main structure of the webpage.
  The only important file we have to maintain is "index.html".

3. src :
- It is a source folder where we are going to write our codes.
- The 2 important files we have to maintain is "index.js"/main.jsx and "App.js/App.jsx".
  - index.js : It is considered as a root file of react.js
  - App.js : It is considered as parent component of react.js

4. package.json & package-lock.json :
- These are the two files where it is considered as directories of the react folder.
- It will give all the information about libraries present in the project.
