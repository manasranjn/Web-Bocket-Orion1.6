# CSS:-
-CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
-CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.
-CSS is used to add style to web pages.
-There are three ways to add style(CSS) to a web page. These are:-
i) Inline CSS
ii) Internal CSS
iii) External CSS

## Inline CSS:-
-Adding styles for an individual element with the help of style attribute.
Syntax:-
<p style="color: red;">This is a paragraph</p>

## Internal CSS:- 
-Used to add styles for multiple elements or writing general styles with the help of style tag inside head tag.
-We need selectors to select or target the element which we need to change style.
Syntax:- 
<style>
    selector{
        css-property: value;
    }
</style>

## External CSS:- 
-Writing styles i a separate CSS file and then connecting it to the HTML document with the help of <link> tag.
-We use <link> tag inside the head tag to connect the external css.
Syntax:- 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="fileName.css">

# Selectors in CSS:- 
CSS selectors are used to select the HTML elements that we want to style.
1.Element Selector:-
-It is used to select the elements based on their tag name.
-Element selector selects all the element with the specific tag name in the entire HTML document.
e.g:- h1{
    font-size: 20px;
}

2. Class Selector:- 
-It selects the HTML elements based on the given class name.
-Class name can be provide by using "class" attribute.
-To selects the classs name in CSS we use dot(.) that acts as class selector.
e.g:- .className{
    color: red;
}

3. ID Selector:-
-It selects the HTML element based on the given ID name.
-ID name can be provide by using "id" attribute.
-ID name should be unique in an HTML document.
-To select the id names in CSS we use hash(#) that acts as ID selector.
e.g:- #idName{
    height: 100px;
}

4. Universal Selector:- 
-It is used to select all the elements in the HTML document.
It is denoted as *
e.g:- *{
    margin: 0;
}

5. Group Selector:-
-It is used to select multiple elements at once.
e.g:- h1, #idName, .className, p{
    background-color: black;
}

6. Descendant Selector:- 
-It is used to select a specific child element within a parent element.
e.g:- .className p{
    color: red;
}

# Pseudo classes:-
-These are used to add styles to selectors but only when selectors meets certain condition.
-Pseudo class are written using colon(:)
e.g:- selector:active/hover
    
# Pseudo elements:-
-It is a keyword added to a selector that lets us style a specific part of the selected element.
-Double colon(::) is used to write Pseudo elements.
e.g:- ::after, ::before, ::first-line, ::first-letter

# Box-Model in CSS:-
-Using box model we can specify how an element should be displayed on the web page by giving properties - height & width, padding, border, and margin.
-The innermost layer of the box model is content itself which includes height and width. Following by padding, border and margin respectively.

## Padding:- It is the inner space between the content and border.
-Padding values will be applied on the four sides of the content when single value is given for padding.
-Padding Syntax:- 
1. padding: 10px (four side equal)
2. padding: top-bottom left-right
3. padding: top left-right bottom
4. padding: top right bottom left

## Border:- Border property is used to define the boundary around an element. 
-Border for a content can be specify using three values.
    -border-size 
    -border-style : solid/dashed/dotted/double
    -border-color
e.g:- border: 10px solid green;
-To curve the edges of border we use border-radius property.
e.g: border-radius: 5px;

## Margin:- It defines the space between one or more elements.
-It is the outer white space of an element.
-It follows the same syntax as padding.
1. margin: 10px (four side equal)
2. margin: top-bottom left-right
3. margin: top left-right bottom
4. margin: top right bottom left

# Box shadow and Text shadow:-
-Box shadow is used to give a shadow effect for a selected element. Whereas text shadow used for text.
Syntax:-
    box-shadow: x-offset y-offset blur color;
    text-shadow: x-offset y-offset blud color;
e.g:-
    .box {
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}
.text {
    text-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
