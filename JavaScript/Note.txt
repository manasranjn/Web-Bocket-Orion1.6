# JavaScript:-
-JavaScript is a scripting and programming language, introduced to perform live-scripting or dynamic responsive on a web-page.
-Netscape Communications hired 'Brendan Eich' to develop a scripting language for their browser, Netscape Navigator. Eich created JavaScript in just 10 days.
-The language was first called "MOCHA", then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript—not because it's related to Java, but as a marketing decision to capitalize on Java’s popularity.
-JavaScript is used for building logics of a web page.
-JavaScript is a high level programming language, used in both client side as well as server side.
-Currently we are using JavaScript version 6 i.e ES6(Echma script 6), which is also called as vanilla JavaScript.
-Node JS is the run time environment of JavaScript.

## What is Scripting language ?
-A scripting language is a type of programming language used to automate tasks that executes line by line.
-For example - JavaScript, Python, PHP... etc.

# Variable Keywords in JS:-
-Variable keywords are used to declare a variable and to initialize a value to variables.
-There are three types of variable keywords:-
    -var
    -let
    -const 
## var:- If a variable is decalred using var keyword then we can re-declare and re-initialize the same variable.

## let:- If a variable is decalred using let keyword then we can re-initialize the same variable but we can't re-declare the same variable.

## const:- Const stands for constant variable.
-If a variable is decalred using const keyword then neither we re-declare nor re-initialize the same variable.

# Datatypes in JS:- 
-Datatypes are used to define which type of value we're storing on a variable.
- By using 'typeof' operator we can check the datatype of a varibale.
-There are two types of datatypes in JavaScript:-
    1.Primitive type
    2.Non-primitive type
Note:- JavaScript is a dynamic typed language that means, datatype of a variable is assigned based on the value passed by the user during runtime.

1. Primitive-type:-
## Number type:- Represents all the possible types of numeric values; like - positive, negative, fraction, whole number, etc..

## String type:- Anything enclosed within single(' ') or double(" ") quote is known as string in JS.
-Basically String is a sequence of character used to represent text.
-We can access each character by using index numbers. string[0], string[1].... .

## boolean type:- It has only two types of values, i.e true and false.
-In JavaScript value of true is 1 and value of false is 0.

## null type:- Null means nothing, which is inherited from Object type. It stores nothing.

## undefined type:-When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, it is automatically initialized with undefined.

## Symbol type:– Used for creating unique values (Symbol("unique"))
-To create a Symbol type variable we need Symbol() operator.

## BigInt type:– Handles very large numbers (BigInt())
-To create a BigInt type varibale we need BigInt() operator.

2. Non-primitive type or Reference Datatype
-Reference datatypes are the type of datatype which can hold multiple element in a single variable.
-Reference datatypes are -> array, object, function
## Array :-Array is a collection of heterogenious(different datatypes) type of data.
-Array indexing start from "0", and to access any value we can use the index position, and arrays are dynamic in size.
-Arrays are used to store multiple values inside a single variable.
ex. let arr = ["hari", "sita", "ram"] 0 1 2

## Object :-Objects are complex data types used to store collection of key value pairs.
-Objects can contain various datatypes, including primitive and non-primitive.
-Keys are unique within an object, and they are used to access the values.
-We can access the value of an object by using dot notation (object.keyName) or bracket notation (object["keyname"]).

ex:-
let obj = { name : "hari", 
    phone : 56789032, 
    address : "bhubaneswar" 
    }
-In the above example left side element are the keys & right side elements are the values of that key.

# Function :-
-functions are the block of code or set of instruction which are used to perform some specific task.
-function reduce our code complexity and help organize logic, improve readability, and make code reusable.
-We need 'function' keyword to create a function in JS.

Syntax :-
function functionName(){ 
    //instruction
 }

function calling ->
functionName();
